# TJADB Website
This repository holds the website for the [TJADB community](https://discord.com/invite/XHcVYKW).
TJADB is a community 

> dedicated to the preservation, creation, and overall discussion of TJA files and Taiko no Tatsujin (太鼓の達人) charting!

## Goals
The goal of this project is to provide a single place where the TJADB community (and others) can host their custom Taiko no Tatsujin (太鼓の達人) charts. Besides hosting the files, the website also documents useful metadata, making everything searchable.

As a secondary goal, guides and extra resources will also be hosted or linked on this website.

## Roadmap
The roadmap - in no particular order - covers:

 * Adding guides to charting, installing TJA players, etc
 * Adding extra resources like skins etc
 * Provide a method for charters to log in and submit/modify TJA's
 * A proper vetting system to make sure the TJA's are standardized, contain all required metadata and have the correct mapping
 * Provide API documentation

### Feature requests
If you'd like to make feature requests, please verify they're not yet on the roadmap, and raise an issue using the Feature Request template. If you would like to make a new feature yourself, create a Feature Request issue and clearly state there that you would like to make it. This way we can approve or dismiss, before you invest time in the feature.
